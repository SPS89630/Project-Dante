    <h1>Welcome to <u>Anger</u></h1>
    <h2>This is where the wrathful and sullen are punished for their sins.</h2>
    <p>The wrathful must fight anyone and anything on the muck, but the Sullen, the ones who are overcome with fury, choke on their own anger under the mud and can do nothing else</p>
    <p>But you can only watch, sailing your boat, across the River Styx.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and sail and give Charon a tip.</p>
